## Area of an Ellipse

An ellipse is a 2D shape defined by a continuous curve and two focus points. The sum of the two distances from the foci to the point is constant throughout the curve. 

#### Terminology
Foci or focus points - these points are equidistant from the center of the ellipse <br>
Major axis - the line drawn cutting the ellipse in half and running through both foci.
Minor axis - the line drawn cutting the ellipse in half and running between both foci.<br>

##### Formula

Area of ellipse =  <span class="texhtml"><span class="texhtml">pi</span> * <i>1/2*major axis</i> * <i>1/2*minor axis</i></span>

##### Example

Given base = 3 cm, height = 5 cm find area of the parallelogram.<br><br>

Area = 3 cm * 5 cm = 15 cm<sup>2</sup>
